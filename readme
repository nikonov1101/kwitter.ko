kwitter
=======

Allows user to access a russian-speaking segment 
of Twitter right from the Linux kernel.

Note that it was build for kernel version 6.9.3
and wasn't carefully tested against a whole 
corpus of the supported versions. 

give it a try:
	apt install linux-header-$(uname -r)
	make 
	insmod kwitter.ko
	cat /dev/kwitter
